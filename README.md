# App Rating Prediction Model
This repository contains a Python-based project aimed at predicting app ratings using data from the Google Play Store. The project leverages data science techniques to explore the relationships between app features and their ratings, offering insights into factors influencing app success.

Key Features:
Dataset: Includes columns such as Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Price, Category, and Content Rating (dummy-encoded for model training).
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, identifies and addresses outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and prepares features for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key patterns, including the impact of app category, price, and size on ratings.
Model Development: Builds a linear regression model for prediction and evaluates its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².
Insights: Highlights trends such as higher ratings for paid apps and the impact of reviews and size on app performance.

Why This Project?
Understanding app ratings is crucial for developers and businesses aiming to improve user satisfaction and app visibility. This model provides actionable insights that can guide development and marketing strategies.
